#### Given n cuboids where the dimensions of the ith cuboid is cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti] (0-indexed). Choose a subset of cuboids and place them on each other.

#### You can place cuboid i on cuboid j if widthi <= widthj and lengthi <= lengthj and heighti <= heightj. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid.

#### Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
Output: 190
Explanation:
Cuboid 1 is placed on the bottom with the 53x37 side facing down with height 95.
Cuboid 0 is placed next with the 45x20 side facing down with height 50.
Cuboid 2 is placed next with the 23x12 side facing down with height 45.
The total height is 95 + 50 + 45 = 190.
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: cuboids = [[38,25,45],[76,35,3]]
Output: 76
Explanation:
You can't place any of the cuboids on the other.
We choose cuboid 1 and rotate it so that the 35x3 side is facing down and its height is 76.
```

##### Constraints:
```
n == cuboids.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= widthi, lengthi, heighti <= 100
```
